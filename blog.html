        <h2>Where Thoughts Learn to Breathe</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my little corner of the internet—where wandering thoughts
          occasionally land a point, and ideas come up for air. <br />Here, I
          jot down what it’s like to shift from finance to tech, to learn code
          after spreadsheets, and to explore how AI might just give your
          favorite auditor a run for their formulas. <br />Whether I’m
          untangling fraud detection models, reflecting on career pivots, or
          stumbling through JavaScript with grace (or grit), this blog is where
          my thoughts find their footing. <br />Karibu!

            From spreadsheet battles to a blinking cursor of newsletter dread.
            Discover the unexpected origins of this blog...
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a time—a couple of years back—when I found myself breaking
            into a polite panic over an empty Word document, a blinking cursor
            mocking me in rhythm. I wasn’t writing code or crafting blog posts
            back then. <br />I was writing a newsletter—yes, one of those email
            missives meant to inform, inspire, and occasionally sweet-talk you
            into showing up at one of our trainings. <br /><br />
            It was called the "KARDS Newsletter", and it was my first real foray
            into public writing. I didn’t have a journalism degree. I wasn’t a
            communications officer. I was a youthful Finance and Admin Assistant
            with a spreadsheet in one hand and a deadline in the other. My
            official job was budgets, logistics, and documents—but somehow, I
            volunteered (or was gently cornered) into running a bi-monthly
            bulletin that later morphed into a monthly feature.
            <br />
            It targeted community development practitioners and grassroots
            organizations—the kind of folk doing hard work in hard places, often
            with little thanks. People I admired. Which made it worse. Because
            every time I sat down to draft an issue, I felt like a fraud trying
            to speak to giants. <br />The pressure to sound “professional” and
            “informed” while also being timely and relevant… well, let’s just
            say, imposter syndrome and I became very close. I’d start with ideas
            that felt strong, then second-guess every sentence. <br />I'd
            wrestle with tone. Should I be formal? Warm? Data-heavy? Light and
            chatty? <br />Sometimes, I’d panic-write entire paragraphs that felt
            more like internal memos than community updates. Other times, I
            missed the soft editorial deadline because I was knee-deep in an
            audit file or chasing a procurement form that had mysteriously
            vanished between departments. <br /><br />
            But you know what? I learned.<br />
            I learned how to coax ideas out of thin air and package them into
            digestible stories. I learned how to listen—really listen—to what
            field officers, coordinators, and beneficiaries were saying during
            check-ins, then weave those insights into something others could
            read and nod at. I learned how to breathe life into statistics, how
            to ask better questions, and most of all, how to hit “Send” even
            when I wasn’t sure if it was good enough. <br /><br />
            That humble little newsletter gave me my first glimpse into the
            power of writing with purpose. It wasn’t about being perfect—it was
            about showing up. And now, many years later, I find myself doing
            that again, but on my own terms.
            <br /><br />
            Welcome to this blog—the curiously breezy side of my journey.
            <br /><br />
            Here, I’m letting go of the pressure to sound like I have all the
            answers. I’m trading the polished newsletter tone for something a
            little more human. A space where I can reflect, explore, and
            sometimes ramble about the intersection of finance, technology,
            creativity, and life in motion. A place where I can ask the
            questions I used to bury under meeting minutes and grant reports.
            <br /><br />
            If you’ve ever felt like a beginner in your own story—whether in a
            new role, a new field, or a new version of yourself—then pull up a
            chair. I’ve been there. I still am.
            <br /><br />
            This blog is for the curious. For the brave. For the quietly
            ambitious and the not-so-sure. It’s a continuation of a journey that
            began with grassroots voices and formatting battles in MS Publisher.
            And it’s just getting interesting.
            <br /><br />
            So… karibu. Let’s keep this breeze moving.

          <h3>From Compliance to Code</h3>
          <p class="preview">
            A curious detour through Finance, Donors, and Dreams...
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me tell you a secret: the life of a traditional finance
            professional in a donor-funded organization is not as quiet as the
            spreadsheet might suggest.
            <br /><br />
            In fact, it's a chaotic dance between deadlines and documentation.
            One moment you're reconciling the petty cash ledger, and the next,
            you're responding to a donor query from three months ago about why a
            payment voucher is missing a signature. It sounds mundane until you
            realize that these documents—hard or soft copy, scanned in
            triplicate, sometimes even notarized—are the bread and butter of
            continued funding.
            <br /><br />
            I spent years in these trenches.
            <br /><br />
            ________________________________________
            <br /><br />
            <strong>The World of Multi-Donor Projects</strong>
            <br />
            Working with multi-donor funded organizations meant living in
            audit-mode by default. Supporting documentation wasn’t just
            “important”—it was gospel. Every payment, whether for salaries,
            travel, or training refreshments, needed proof. Timesheets.
            Receipts. Quotations. Signed approvals. And when those weren't
            airtight, the dreaded review queries would land. Monthly.
            <br /><br />
            Payroll wasn’t a simple disbursement—it was a careful choreography
            of statutory deductions (PAYE, NHIF/SHIF, NSSF), approvals, tax
            submissions, and reconciliations. Burn-rate calculations needed to
            be up-to-date to inform budget variance analyses and donor
            reporting. The dreaded underspending or overspending alerts? Yes,
            those too.
            <br /><br />
            Procurement wasn’t a run to the shop. It was a process—soliciting
            three quotes, reviewing for fairness, evaluating against policy,
            justifying selections. All while ensuring internal controls weren’t
            just “in place,” but actively respected. You learned to implement
            policy, but also tweak it when reality punched.
            <br /><br />
            And then came HR. Reviewing timesheets, approving leave, supporting
            staff travel, and sorting accommodation logistics for visiting
            consultants or program beneficiaries. Sometimes you'd find yourself
            managing the company car logbook in the morning and answering a
            finance policy query by lunch.
            <br /><br />
            It was everything, everywhere, all at once.
            <br /><br />
            But within that intensity, there was growth. You became a
            cross-functional operator. You led when needed, adapted when
            required, and met your update meetings with a mix of exhaustion and
            pride. You learned how organizations actually breathe. You saw how
            leadership isn’t just in the title—it’s in keeping the engine
            running behind the scenes.
            <br /><br />
            ________________________________________
            <br /><br />
            <strong
              >Shifting Gears: Welcome to Construction and Commerce</strong
            >
            <br />
            When I moved into commercial enterprises—specifically construction
            and engineering—the world tilted.
            <br /><br />
            Gone were donor frameworks and burn-rates. Here, the goal was
            profitability. Every decision had a price tag, and that tag had to
            be justified through a business lens, not a development one.
            <br /><br />
            Tax obligations evolved—suddenly, VAT returns and withholding tax
            compliance took center stage. Ownership structures became more
            concentrated. Approvals were faster, but the pressure to deliver was
            tighter. Donor goodwill was replaced by investor/owner
            expectations.<br />
            You didn’t have quarterly review meetings—you had directors asking
            why the site delayed delivery by a day and what it meant for
            cashflow.
            <br /><br />
            And yet, my donor-funded background helped. My processes were
            airtight. My compliance game strong. My ability to handle audits,
            deadlines, and documentation gave me an edge. What they needed was
            order. What I had was just that—seasoned, stress-tested, and
            systems-oriented.
            <br /><br />
            ________________________________________
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Now Entering: Tech Territory</strong>
            <br />
            Then came a deeper nudge. A feeling. A shift.
            <br /><br />
            The world was changing. Digital transformation wasn’t just a
            buzzword anymore—it was the new minimum. And I knew that if I wanted
            to future-proof my career, I couldn’t sit in yesterday’s tools while
            tomorrow’s tech left me behind.
            <br /><br />
            So here I am. A finance and administration professional, knee-deep
            in HTML and Python, teaching myself how to build AI-powered
            financial tools while figuring out how to pay the bills in the
            meantime.
            <br /><br />
            And it’s terrifying.
            <br /><br />
            Not because the tech world is unkind—but because the terrain is
            unfamiliar. I don’t have a Computer Science degree. I don’t speak
            “backend” fluently yet. And transitioning as an older professional,
            especially when the job market is flooded with younger, tech-native
            talent, can feel like starting from scratch in a language you’re
            still learning to pronounce.
            <br /><br />
            It’s even harder when you add context: USAID and other donor fund
            cuts mean fewer opportunities in the non-profit sector, more
            competition, and tighter belts across the board. Many of us with
            years of experience are now fishing in the same small pond,
            wondering if it’s time to switch lakes altogether.
            <br /><br />
            But here’s the thing: while I may not be “tech-born,” I’m
            problem-tested. I bring years of financial insight, organizational
            discipline, and compliance-driven thinking—things even the best
            developers sometimes overlook. I’m not here to replace the coder—I’m
            here to complement them, to bring structure, financial management
            and understanding into a world full of innovation but sometimes
            short on operational grounding.
            <br /><br />
            ________________________________________
            <br /><br />
            <strong>So, Why This Story?</strong>
            <br />
            Because somewhere out there is someone like me—maybe mid-career,
            maybe at a crossroads—wondering if it’s too late to pivot, to learn,
            to explore. It’s not. The trick is to let your past become your
            springboard, not your ceiling.
            <br /><br />
            Finance taught me about systems. Donors taught me about
            accountability. Construction taught me about performance. And now,
            tech is teaching me about reinvention.
            <br /><br />
            We don’t need to abandon our history. We just need to remix it for
            the future.
            <br /><br />
            I hope this piece reminded you that growth isn’t linear. It’s
            layered.
